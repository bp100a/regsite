# regsite
Dr. Regina Collins' website, based on Hugo dream-plus template

This is a Hugo generated website that is maintained using CircleCI and a Continuous Deployment process. Just to make it cooler, it's hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+.

So edits made locally are pushed to GitHub and then CircleCI picks them up and "builds" the website. This is then pushed to the Raspberry Pi.

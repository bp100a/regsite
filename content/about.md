<h1>So, Who Am I?</h1>

----
<br>
This website provides examples of my work spanning Institutional Research, Information Systems, and Technical Communication. Below is some background information about me.

I originally graduated from NJIT with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, but realized that my true passion lay in sharing knowledge.  Therefore, upon graduation, I immediately applied for a position as a technical writer, and I worked in that field for 20 years, focusing particularly on software documentation.

My technical background is a great benefit to my work and my research, as can be seen from my resume.  After returning to NJIT and completing a Master of Science in Professional and Technical Communication, I continued my education, pursuing a doctorate in Information Systems with a focus on technology enhanced learning knowledge management.

After completing my doctorate, I began working in higher education, first as the Associate Director for Writing, Communication, and Outreach in the Albert Dorman Honors College, and subsequently as the Associate Director for Assessment and Evaluation in the university's Office of Institutional Effectiveness.

I am proud of the following awards and recognitions:

* Recipient of university award for Excellence in Instruction by a Teaching Assistant (2015)
* Member of research team awarded First Place in Dana Knox Research Showcase for Graduate Student Research (2015)
* Recipient, Alumni (Class of 1958) Fellowship (2014-2015)
* Recipient, Constance A. Murray Scholarship (2014)
* Third place Best Practitioner Oriented Paper, Americas Conference on Information Systems (2013)
* Member and Vice President, Alpha Epsilon Lambda (AEL), the Graduate student Honor Society

Learning to be a teacher - to facilitate the learning of the students in your class - is a critical skill. To ensure that doctoral students are well prepared for careers as instructors, New Jersey Institute of Technology requires that students teach at least one course during their time as a doctoral candidate. I am fortunate to have gained invaluable teaching experience through various stages of exposure to instruction.
<p>
I started as a Teaching Assistant for the graduate-level Systems Analysis and Design course for two semesters. I was subsequently an Apprentice Teacher for the undergraduate level Systems Analysis and Design course for one semester. My independent teaching assignments and evaluations are listed in the table below.

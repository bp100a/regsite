To better illustrate my technical communication skills, I have included some examples of my work from my Master of Professional and Technical Communication.
<p>
<a href="/publications/CCC Brochure.pdf">CorpCommCollab brochure</a> - I designed this brochure to serve as a marketing tool for a collaborative wiki created by all the students in the Corporate Communication seminar. The brochure is designed to be visually appealing and to provide sufficient information to create interest in our collaborative wiki.
<p>
<a href="/publications/7 things.pdf">Seven Things You Should Know About ... Microsoft Live Mesh</a>- this document was created in response to an assignment to mimic the style and format of a popular website to introduce new technology to non-technical users. After researching my selected product, I created a document that closely resembled the original website, using eye-catching colors and crisp images to enhance the non-technical description.

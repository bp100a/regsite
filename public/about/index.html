<h1>So, Who Am I?</h1>

<hr />

<p><br>
This website provides examples of my work in Information Systems research, teaching, and Technical Communication. Below is some background information about me.</p>

<p>I originally graduated from NJIT with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, but realized that my true passion lay in helping people interact with technology.  Therefore, upon graduation, I immediately applied for a position as a technical writer, and I worked in that field for 20 years, focusing particularly on software documentation.</p>

<p>My technical background is a great benefit to my work and my research, as can be seen from my resume.  After returning to NJIT and completing a Master of Science in Professional and Technical Communication, I decided to expand my expertise in computer human interaction by pursuing a doctorate in Information Systems with a focus on technology enhanced learning and social network analysis.</p>

<p>I am proud to acknowledge the following recognitions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Nominee for Excellence in Instruction by a Teaching Assistant award (2015)</li>
<li>Member of research team awarded First Place in Dana Knox Research Showcase for Graduate Student Research (2015)</li>

      <description>My technical writing experience was an excellent preparation for a career as a researcher. In my writing, I focus on presenting information in a clear and concise manner and supporting my results and conclusions with well established theoretical underpinnings.  Share and Share Alike: Integrating Internet Resource Sharing Into Learning - This paper is being presented at the 2015 Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS) as a completed research paper. The research reported in this paper pulls from my doctoral dissertation and a complementary study conducted with other NJIT doctoral candidates.</description>

      <description>Learning to be a teacher - to facilitate the learning of the students in your class - is a critical skill. To ensure that doctoral students are well prepared for careers as instructors, New Jersey Institute of Technology requires that students teach at least one course during their time as a doctoral candidate. I am fortunate to have gained invaluable teaching experience through various stages of exposure to instruction.  I started as a Teaching Assistant for the graduate-level Systems Analysis and Design course for two semesters.</description>

      <description>In addition to papers, an important way for researchers to communicate their work is through posters and presentations.  The following links provide some highlights of my research posters. Presentations can be viewed on SlideShare.  More Than The Sum of Its Parts: Advancing Women at NJIT Through Collaborative Research Networks - Having been nominated to present my research at the Dana Knox Student Research Showcase, I designed this poster to highlight research we were doing to understand the position of women faculty in their departmental social networks, seeking to understand if isolation or other factors caused women faculty to be underrepresented in the university.</description>

      <description>To better illustrate my technical communication skills, I have included some examples of my work from my Master of Professional and Technical Communication.  CorpCommCollab brochure - I designed this brochure to serve as a marketing tool for a collaborative wiki created by all the students in the Corporate Communication seminar. The brochure is designed to be visually appealing and to provide sufficient information to create interest in our collaborative wiki.</description>

      <description>So, Who Am I? 
This website provides examples of my work in Information Systems research, teaching, and Technical Communication. Below is some background information about me.
I originally graduated from NJIT with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, but realized that my true passion lay in helping people interact with technology. Therefore, upon graduation, I immediately applied for a position as a technical writer, and I worked in that field for 20 years, focusing particularly on software documentation.</description>
